  <p>In the Matrix (a universe the humanity is unknowingly trapped inside, a simulated reality where intelligent machines have been created to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source), we need only two types of pills: red or blue to select our destiny. Neo must select his to find the path. You have a list of pills of different colour, and you must filter out only the red and blue ones and help Neo to solve his dilemma.</p>
